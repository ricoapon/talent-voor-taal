<p>Talent voor Taal is based in the The Hague area and offers professional tuition in Dutch. Training
  modules are available both for native speakers who wish to improve certain aspects of their Dutch and
  for foreign students who wish to communicate more easily with their Dutch friends, colleagues and
  neighbours. The training methods are flexible and tuition will be adapted to your individual level and
  personal learning style.</p>

<p>Before subscribing to the training you will be invited for an interview (without obligation). Together we
  will discuss your entrance level and training needs. Taking your course goals, budget and time
  schedule into account, we can then draw up a tailor-made training format and planning.
  Interested? For more information (in Dutch or English), please contact me.</p>
